# You can try this live by starting the manual-test.html file, 
# but first: execute webpack in the src folder. 
# Running the node converter is destructive! as long as 
# you do not set editMode to false, then it will rely on copies. 
# Meaning you shouldn't edit your template files while editing 
# by the converter and definition yaml files, which can also 
# be done in live by the watcher in main.ts
